Math Temlate
============

Thought I was going to make a presentation about why e^iÏ€ + 1 = 0,
so this repo hooks MathJax and function-plot into an html file
so that I could write equations and show graphs. Not a lot of work done,
but the wiring is in place, and that's usually the hurdle.

You're welcome to use it, if you get far enough w/ it that you make
some worthwhile changes (eg a stylesheet or compile it from markdown or something),
then a PR would be appreciated.

To use it
---------

Install with `sh build.sh` (figured I'd put all the steps in there so I didn't
have to memorize yet another toolchain)

Then just straight open the file in your browser (Mac has a convenient `open`
command: `open index.html`, you can switch the browser it chooses with the `-a`
flag, eg `open -a Safari.app index.html`)

At this point, I just tab between my browser and the document and
refresh the browser to see updates.
